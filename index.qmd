## Course objectives

By the end of the week, participants would be able to design social
network research, collect network data from classical to digital
information, describe and visualise networks, and perform statistical
models using social networks (e.g., ERGM and RSIENA). They will also
have an overview of the most relevant topics about social networks.
During the week, participants would have lectures and practical
experience in using the R software and engage in practical experience
through group projects.

The course will:

-   Introduce the idea of social network research.

-   Explain how to collect, describe and visualise networks.

-   Explain how to model social networks.

-   Provide hands-on training to use R to investigate social networks.
