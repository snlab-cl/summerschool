They will also have an overview of the most relevant topics about social networks. During the week, participants would have lectures and practical experience in using the R software and engage in practical experience through group projects.\nThe course will:\n\nIntroduce the idea of social network research.\nExplain how to collect, describe and visualise networks.\nExplain how to model social networks.\nProvide hands-on training to use R to investigate social networks."
